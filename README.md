# About
My personal discord bot written in C++, using the D++ library. Made for players of the mobile game *Overmortal - Idle RPG*

# Features
Many features are currently under construction!
See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for progress.

## Sect-Clash Array Sign Up
Help automate sign up process by scheduling polls where players can vote to sign up for certain roles (such as physical array passenger) in arrays before sect clash happens.

## Cultivation Caculator (under construction)
[click here to see calculator documentation](docs/Calculator.md)

An interactive calculator that produces an estimate of how much longer it takes to breakthrough to the next major cultivation stage.

***Work in progress!!!*** To try out partly implemented features, use `/debug calc start`



## Funny emoji shenanigans (under construction)
Some servers have a running joke about feet fetish, thus some members have requested a function to let the bot spits out feet emojis based on commands

***Not yet implemented!!!*** I will start working on this after construction is done.
