# Cultivation Calculator Overview

This document outlines the calculation which would be performed by the bot to produce an estimate of how much longer it takes for a player to reach the next major cultivation stage.

This document will be divided into four sections, each focuses on a crucial source of cultivation exp income:
1. [Cultivation™ and Aura Gem](#cultivation-and-aura-gem)
2. [Cultivation Pills](#cultivation-pills)
3. [Myrimon Fruits and the Aura Extractor](#myrimon-fruits-and-the-aura-extractor)
4. [Creation Aftifacts: the Vase and the Mirror](#creation-artifacts-the-vase-and-the-mirror)

## Cultivation™ and Aura Gem

Cultivation™ and aura gem are players' passive cultivation exp income sources, with the aura gem being dependent on cultivation speed, and thus are discussed as a whole in this section. 

The calculation is straight forward:

$$\text{Exp} = \text{AbodeAura} \times (\text{AbsorptionRate}_{\text{Player}} + \text{AbsorptionRate}_{\text{Aura Gem}})$$

Where:
- $\text{Exp}$ is the cultivation exp income per unit time
- $ \text{AbsorptionRate}_{\text{Aura Gem}} $ is dependent on $ \text{AbsorptionRate}_{\text{player}} $ and the quality of the aura gem
